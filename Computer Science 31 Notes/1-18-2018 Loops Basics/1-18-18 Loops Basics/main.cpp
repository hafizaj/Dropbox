//Indeterminate loop

//do while loop difference
/*
 guaranteed to run at least once because the test is run at the top, not at the bottom.
 goal is to make this false
 and then it will terminate
 
 Possiblilites:
 true/false never reached false condition
 do....while will at least run once.
 
 --------
 special note
 do {
 cout << " x*y/n ";
 x++;
 } while (x < y ) ; needs a semicolon after "while"
 
 while guards the body
 do-while actually executes the code

//do-while with a multistatement body
