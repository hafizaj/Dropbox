/*
 Some notes about Cstirngs
 
 
 ---By convention, Cstrings are always null terminated.
 ---Must have an extra element in your array for this character.
 ---Cstrings are always partially filled array.
 ---Are arrays with an extra letter \0 (Null terminating chracter)
 ---Example
 char u[] = "Howie!"
 H - o - w - i -e - ! - \0 <--- this is the extra element in the array
 
 char v[] = "abc"
 &
 char w[] = {'a','b','c'} are not equivalent because the first one is a cstring while the second one is an actual
 array meant for characters / no null-terminating character needed.
 
 char x[5];
 x = "Foo" is wrong because c-strings cannot be assigned a value
 You can assign individual character.
 
 
 Never write over the ending null-terminating character --- you will get unpredictable results if you do so.
