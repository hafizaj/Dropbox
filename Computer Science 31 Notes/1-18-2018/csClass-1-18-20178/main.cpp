 Only put in errors that were posted on Stahl's website :
 If the name has digits in it , its a perfectly good name : only error when empty ""
 Report on the very first error that you find.
 If you get error, you can keep prompting for the data , and then
 IF you get error , and then prompt the error immediately.

//Notes
/*
 C++ is lazy
 if cost = 50.000... , C++ will print out ---> 50
 if cost = 50.1 ... , C++ will print out ----> 50.1
 
 
 Integer division problems and how division works with floating point values:
 
 if both sides of equation are integers , C++ will not divide properly and instead will perform integer division
 C++ integer division, in only returns an integer quantity
 if any one of the operands are floating point values, no longer perform integer division
 
 
 Common errors
 double oneTenthZero = ( one / 10 ) will return zero ;
 because 1/10 is still an integer division
 
 to avoid this
 double oneTenthZero = ( 1.0 / 10.0 ) only takes one decimal point to turn this into a floating point value
 
 ------------------
 Modulus only works for integer operands !!!!!!!!!
 to get a remainder
 int one = 1 % 10
 
 int WONTWORK = 1.0 % 10.0
 doublt QTY = 1.0
 int WONTWORK = QTY % 10;
 
 
 // how many times 1 go into 10 left over < modulus operator >
 // only work when both sides are integer.
 
 both sides to be int for an integer division to take place.
 
 TRICK QUESTION
 var_a * ( 1/ 4 ) is not a QUARTER !!!! it is actually ( 1/4 ) = 0
 
 C++ uses short-circuit evalutaion
 The evaluation of condition stops because the condition turns false ( in case of && ) or when the condition turns true (in the case of ||)
 basically if it knows the answer is false, it will terminate looking other potential candidates.
 
 Precedence rules
 --------
 AND comes before OR
 indentation means nothing, squiggles are the things that count
 
 
 else if ( c++ will choose the first one that it finds as true )
 when everything above it works out that it doesnt not passes through
 
 if you use nested if-else statements: //indentation leads us to belive that it is connected.
    if ( precipitating )
        if  ( temperate < 32 )
            cout << "It's snowing !" << endl;
        else...
