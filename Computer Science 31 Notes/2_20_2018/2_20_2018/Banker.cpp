/*
 Exception handling is different
 
 Different
 
 
 Without a try catch block, when you actually running, then
 
 When you have code that throws, you want a driver code that catches.
 
 
 
 If you want a catch block, it has to be attached to a catch block
 
 Like an else statement without an if statement.
 
 Catch --- if it didnt succeed , do the stuff in the catch block
